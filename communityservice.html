                        <h4><q>It's not about how much you do, but how much love you put into what you do that counts.</q>- Mother Teresa</h4>
                        <p>Yogesh Gurung is friendly and compassionate. He  enjoys helping people from the bottom of his heart. He started to work as a volunteer in his free time. He worked as a volunteer in the elderly home in Kathmandu. He finds many socially disadvantaged children and people in the street of Kathmandu city. As a realisation of responsible members of the community, he starts volunteering the non profit organisations work to support those people.</p>

                        <p>Gurung is not satisfied with volunteering to these people partially. He fully motivates himself to work as a full time social worker and runs the NGO “A Cup of Love” to support and help those needy. The new organisation works to support the street children and encourage them to leave the street life. They are also encouraged to leave the addiction of drugs and bad health habits. 
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="heading">Transforming community</h3>
                        <p>Social activities were extended to the new dimension from the program in the street to  rehabilitate the homeless to home. Young children are sent to the schools. Children are encouraged to live good lives at home and engage them in recreation.
                        </p>

                        <p>NGo "A Cup oF Love" was more generous to participate in the local community school.  More volunteers are organised to support the school in various ways. Volunteering teachers were added to support the school and the socially disadvantaged children were sent to the school.
