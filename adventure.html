                        <h3><q>Mountains are not fair or unfair, they are just dangerous.</q> --Reinhold Messner</h3>
                        <p>Nepal is a mountainous country where  fourteen 8,000 meters  high mountains of the world are located in this small landlocked himmalayan country. World highest peak of the world “Mt. Everserst” lies in this land. It is always the centre of attraction of the adventure lover and mountaineer.
                         </p>
                        
                         <p>Tough geographical location has made our lifestyle more tough. People from our community have a hard life and they choose hard things. Adventure is what they stream in their bloodline. This is how adventure and mountaineering has started in my life.
                        </p>

                        <h3 class="heading">Mountaineering
                        </h3>
                        <p>Yogi started mountaineering in 2015 AD. In 2016, he was able to ascend Mt Amadablam which is at altitude of  6,856 m from sea level. This mountain is technically challenging and difficult to climb. The climbing grade is 5.7.  Similarly, he successfully ascended the Mt. Lobuche, Mt. Island peak and Mt. Pokalde consequtively in a very short period of time.</p>
                        <p>The successful conquest of the 7,000 meters peak had motivated the Yogi to further the continuity of mountaineering. He successfully completed the training sessions conducted by the Nepal Mountaineering Association, Nepal Mountaineering Instructor Association, Nepal Mountaineering Guide Association and National Association of Tourism and Hospitality in various time periods.

                        <h3 class="heading">Rock climbing and indoor climbing
                        </h3>
                        <p>Rock climbing is another adrenaline sport that Yogi loves when he is free. Climbing increases the physical endurance and agility of the human brain. It gives fitness and courage to start challenging work.

                        </p>
